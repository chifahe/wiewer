# wiewerï¼šA simple and compact media viewer

wiewer is a simple and compact media viewer for those who don't want their system to become too bloated.

It essentially opens files through the Microsoft Edge, so it can support most types of files while maintaining a small size.

Advantages:

1. The size of the executable file is small.
2. Supports most commonly used media files.
3. (if Edge is allowed to run in the background) Starts faster.

disadvantages:

1. Only operating systems with WebView2 Runtime installed (such as Windows 10 and Windows 11) are supported.
